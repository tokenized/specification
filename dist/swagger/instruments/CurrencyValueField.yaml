  Precision:
    description:  >
      Specify the decimal precision of the value. It will normally be the "precision" value
      associated with the Currency. It is the number of decimal places between the number of tokens
      and the common unit of measure. For example, in AUD, the common unit is the dollar, but a token
      would only be worth a penny. So the precision should be 2 for the two decimal places in a
      dollar amount "$1.00". In this scenario 100 tokens are worth $1. Zero is assumed if no value is
      specified.
    type: number
