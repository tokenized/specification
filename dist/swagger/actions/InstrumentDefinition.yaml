  This action is used by the administration to define the properties/characteristics of the
  instrument (token) that it wants to create. An instrument has a unique identifier called
  InstrumentID = InstrumentType + base58(InstrumentCode + checksum). An instrument is always linked
  to a contract that is identified by the public address of the Contract wallet.
type: object

  InstrumentPermissions:
    description:  >
      A set of permission objects containing switches and field references that define the
      permissions for modifying this instrument. See the Permission documentation for more detail.
    type: string
    example: "151c232a31383f464d545b626970777e858c939aa1a8afb6"
  EnforcementOrdersPermitted:
    description:  >
      Set to true if the administration is permitted to make enforcement orders on user tokens and
      balances, otherwise set to false to disable this feature.
    type: boolean
    example: 1
  VotingRights:
    description:  >
      When false holders of this instrument will not be able to vote for tokens of this instrument
      even on voting systems in which vote multiplers are not permitted.
    type: boolean
    example: true
  VoteMultiplier:
    description:  >
      Multiplies a vote by the specified integer. Where 1 token is equal to 1 vote with a 1 for vote
      multipler (normal), 1 token = 3 votes with a multiplier of 3, for example. If zero, then
      holders of this instrument don't get any votes for their tokens.
    type: number
    example: 3
  AdministrationProposal:
    description:  >
      Set to true if the administration is permitted to make proposals outside of the smart contract
      scope.
    type: boolean
    example: true
  HolderProposal:
    description:  >
      Set to true if a holder is permitted to make proposals outside of the smart contract scope.
    type: boolean
    example: true
  InstrumentModificationGovernance:
    description:  >
      Supported values: 1 - Contract-wide Instrument Governance. 0 - Instrument-wide Instrument
      Governance.  If a referendum or initiative is used to propose a modification to a subfield
      controlled by the instrument permissions, then the vote will either be a contract-wide vote
      (all instruments vote on the referendum/initiative) or an instrument-wide vote (only this
      instrument votes on the referendum/initiative) depending on the value in this subfield.  The
      voting system specifies the voting rules.
    type: number
    example: 1
  AuthorizedTokenQty:
    description:  >
      The number of tokens authorized to be issued for this instrument. Set to greater than zero for
      fungible tokens. If the value is 1 then it becomes a non-fungible token, where the contract
      would have many instruments. Set to 0 to represent a placeholder instrument, where tokens are
      to be issued later, or to represent a decomissioned instrument where all tokens have been
      revoked.
    type: number
    example: 1000000
  InstrumentType:
    description: A code representing the type of instrument and the structure of the payload.
    type: string
    example: "CCY"
  InstrumentPayload:
    description:  >
      A custom payload that contains meta data about this instrument. Payload structure and length is
      dependent on the instrument type chosen. See instrument documentation for more details.
    type: string
    example: "151c232a31383f464d545b626970777e858c939aa1a8afb6"
