  label: Contract Offer Action
  description: "The Contract Offer action allows the Issuer to tell the smart contract what they want the details (labels, data, T&C's, etc.) of the Contract to be on-chain in a public and immutable way. The Contract Offer action 'initializes' a generic smart contract that has been spun up by either the Smart Contract Operator or the Issuer. This on chain action allows for the positive response from the smart contract with either a Contract Formation Action or a Rejection Action."

    description: "All actions related to the contract will cease to work after this timestamp. The smart contract will stop running.

The smart contract will facilitate exchange and send transactions up until the 6th of June.  Wallets can use this to forget tokens that are no longer valid - or at least store them in an 'Expired' folder."
