# Contract Offer Action: The Contract Offer action allows the Issuer to tell the smart contract what they want the details (labels, data, T&C's, etc.) of the Contract to be on-chain in a public and immutable way. The Contract Offer action 'initializes' a generic smart contract that has been spun up by either the Smart Contract Operator or the Issuer. This on-chain action allows for the positive response from the smart contract with either a Contract Formation Action or a Rejection Action.
