        Required field to specify the decimal precision of the value. It will normally be the 
        "precision" value associated with the Currency. It is the number of decimal places between 
        the number of tokens and the common unit of measure. For example, in AUD, the common unit is 
        the dollar, but a token would only be worth a penny. So the precision should be 2 for the 
        two decimal places in a dollar amount "$1.00". In this scenario 100 tokens are worth $1.
