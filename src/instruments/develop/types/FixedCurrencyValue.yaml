  - name: Precision
    label: Precision
    description: >
        Specify the decimal precision of the value. It will normally be the "precision" value
        associated with the Currency. It is the number of decimal places between the number of
        tokens and the common unit of measure. For example, in AUD, the common unit is the dollar,
        but a token would only be worth a penny. So the precision should be 2 for the two decimal
        places in a dollar amount "$1.00". In this scenario 100 tokens are worth $1. Zero is assumed
        if no value is specified.
