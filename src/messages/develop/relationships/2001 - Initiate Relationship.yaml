label: Initiate Relationship
description: "A message used to initiate a new relationship between 2 or more parties. The M1 container specifies the sender tx input and requested participant tx outputs. If there are more than 2 parties the encryption secret provided in the envelope protocol is used as the base encryption secret. If there are only 2 parties, then the ECDH secret of each key pair is used to encrypt each message."

  - name: Flag
    label: Flag
    description: "The flag can optionally be used to identify messages in the relationship so that all members don't have to be tagged in each message. It isn't needed for two party relationships, but is recommended for relationships with more members. It will be included in it's own op return for all message transactions. It is recommended to be a random 20 byte value similar to public key hashes. The flag will be the Payload of an Envelope protocol message with a Payload Protocol ID of \"F\". If this value is not specified then there must be an output to the next key in the relationship chain for every member in the group."

    description: "Type of encryption used for messages within the relationship. 0 - Encryption keys embedded in envelope protocol. 1 - Encryption key embedded in this message is used as base key for future messages. Used for relationships with more than 2 members so the encryption key doesn't have to be encrypted to each member in every message."
